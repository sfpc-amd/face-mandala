Facial Mandala
===============

(until I think of a better name)

Drawing John/James Whitney-style animations using GL shaders, and manipulating them using `ofxFaceTracker`.

Notes
-----

 - Maybe frag shader isn't the best way to draw lissajous lines? It's very slooow.


Todo
----

- [x] Setup basic lissajous shader https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdSGzh
- [x] Setup basic ofxGUI to adjust inputs
- [x] Setup ofxOSC to recieve from FaceOSC
- [x] Tie in FaceOSC to ofxGUI and shader
- [x] Replace shader with oF rendered lissajou shape
- [ ] Incorporate ofxFaceTracker directly (rather than using FaceOSC)
- [ ] Explore different compositions for the main figure
- [ ] Explore vert shaders
- [ ] Explore frag shaders
- [ ] Explore geometry shaders?
